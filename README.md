Avoid pushing grammar errors to prod!

This Github workflow action sends any new text added in a PR to GPT Edit for grammar review.

## Add to your repo

1) Copy the .yml and .js files to your repo to the same paths. Use one of the [releases](https://github.com/MarcoWorms/DocuDroid/releases) to guarantee that you are using a stable version of DocuDroid.
2) In your repo settings go to "enviroments" and add a github token as `GH_TOKEN` and openai token as `OPENAI_TOKEN`
3) It's done, new PRs opened against your repo will have a reply with grammar fixes for new text added
4) If you want to change the Edit prompt being sent to OpenAI change this [line](https://github.com/MarcoWorms/actions-test/blob/main/script.js#L34)

## What I want it to do:

- Typos and grammar 
- Narrator tone standardization
- Jargon removal
- Reduce useless words
- Break long phrases and sentences into smaller ones
- Top-to-bottom concept linearization (explain concepts before usage)
- Technical review (factual review)
